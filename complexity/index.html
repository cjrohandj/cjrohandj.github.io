<p>I was inspired to write this after reading a passage from the Feynman lectures.</p>

   <blockquote> Of course we must emphasize that classical physics is also indeterminate, in a sense. It is usually thought that this indeterminacy, that we cannot predict the future, is an important quantum-mechanical thing, and this is said to explain the behavior of the mind, feelings of free will, etc. But if the world were classical—if the laws of mechanics were classical—it is not quite obvious that the mind would not feel more or less the same. It is true classically that if we knew the position and the velocity of every particle in the world, or in a box of gas, we could predict exactly what would happen. And therefore the classical world is deterministic. Suppose, however, that we have a finite accuracy and do not know exactly where just one atom is, say to one part in a billion. Then as it goes along it hits another atom, and because we did not know the position better than to one part in a billion, we find an even larger error in the position after the collision. And that is amplified, of course, in the next collision, so that if we start with only a tiny error it rapidly magnifies to a very great uncertainty. To give an example: if water falls over a dam, it splashes. If we stand nearby, every now and then a drop will land on our nose. This appears to be completely random, yet such a behavior would be predicted by purely classical laws. The exact position of all the drops depends upon the precise wigglings of the water before it goes over the dam. How? The tiniest irregularities are magnified in falling, so that we get complete randomness. Obviously, we cannot really predict the position of the drops unless we know the motion of the water absolutely exactly.

    Speaking more precisely, given an arbitrary accuracy, no matter how precise, one can find a time long enough that we cannot make predictions valid for that long a time. Now the point is that this length of time is not very large. It is not that the time is millions of years if the accuracy is one part in a billion. The time goes, in fact, only logarithmically with the error, and it turns out that in only a very, very tiny time we lose all our information. If the accuracy is taken to be one part in billions and billions and billions—no matter how many billions we wish, provided we do stop somewhere—then we can find a time less than the time it took to state the accuracy—after which we can no longer predict what is going to happen! It is therefore not fair to say that from the apparent freedom and indeterminacy of the human mind, we should have realized that classical “deterministic” physics could not ever hope to understand it, and to welcome quantum mechanics as a release from a “completely mechanistic” universe. For already in classical mechanics there was indeterminability from a practical point of view. </blockquote>

<p>The physics isn’t as important as the idea that complexity and nuance exist everywhere, not just at ‘higher’ levels of a subject. A lot of the time, we ignore this nuance at the lower level and focus on the things that sound cool, like quantum mechanics, deep learning, econometrics. I think we have this tendency to ascribe intelligence judgements to people who are studying things that sound cool. For example, when I told other students I was taking Calc 3 they wouldn’t care but when I said special relativity they would instantly think I was smarter even though in my opinion they are probably equal indicators of intelligence or whatever. This applies to me as well, if someone told me they were taking calc 1 I would immediately be less excited than if someone told me they were taking optimization or something even though epsilon delta is pretty hard.</p>

<p>This is bad. First because its obviously bad to judge someones intelligence based on what they are studying, but more importantly because it removes attention from these fundamental subjects. People will rush through calculus to get to “real math”, people will rush through mechanics to get to “cool physics” and in the process these subjects get turned into stepping stones, and their own mystery gets tossed to the side.</p>

<p>The actually cool parts of what we are learning is hidden underneath the complexity we are constantly chasing.</p>
