        <p>Theres this sort of famous talk given by Hamming titled <a href = "https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html"> You and Your Research </a>. </p>
<p>I vividly remember reading this for the first time off of Sam Altman's blog during winter quarter when I was walking across the quad from the politics of interdependence to engineering problem solving. I ended up finishing reading it before class and wasn't really able to pay attention during class which is both a testament to the talk (read it!) but also to the absolute nonsense that is the UC Davis lower division engineering curriculum. 
<p>A general summary, both for those that didn't read and so you can get my understanding is this: <br> <br>-work courageously hard on small problems <br>-stay focused on your problems <br>-work with your door open <br>-asserting your ego is needless work<br>-people who work hard tend to get lucky</p> <p>I don't think I'm even qualified enough that my agreement to this advice in the context of producing good research is meaningful, but I do agree. What I don't agree with is Hamming's consuming focus on research. It seems to be an underlying message in his talk that: <br><br> 1. You should want to produce something worthwhile <br> 2. To produce something worthwhile you must be almost consumed by it <br><br> But I think theres so much more to life that people like Hamming seem to miss. </a></p>
<p>Watching a nice sunset on the beach, talking with a friend until you forget the time, hitting a new exercise pr, these are all things that make me happy, and the reason they make me so happy is because when they are happening, I am fully in the moment. A life consumed by one activity makes this kind of enjoyment immensely difficult to find.</p>
<p>Hamming justifies his work ethic by saying he wanted to do important things, but wasn't as naturally talented as his peers. But if aren't so naturally talented, why should you want to output the same quality of work? Sacrificing sleep, relationships, family, for something that someone else could have done for less effort by someone else doesn't feel admirable, it almost feels selfish.</p>
<p>I understand that some people believe that they need to contribute to the "common good", or help future generations with knowledge they acquire, but I think there are better ways to do this. Show up for your neighbors, spend time with your friends, do things that make you happier, and the people around you will be happier too. More than anything now, the world needs more happy people who believe in the common good.</p>
<p>I don't think I'll contribute to any body of work with volume anywhere close to that of Hamming, but I know that I am very happy, both with my current life and where I see my future. I truly hope that people with Hammings mentality can say the same.</p>
<p><br>Thanks for reading,<br>Rohan</p>
